# Simple Shell Project

This project is a simple UNIX command interpreter implemented in C programming language. It was created as part of the curriculum for the Holberton School Software Engineering program.

## Learning Objectives

The goal of the project is to create a shell that can interpret and execute simple UNIX commands. By completing this project, we will gain knowledge on how a shell works, how to create processes, how to manipulate the environment of the current process, and more.

## Usage

To use this simple shell, compile all `.c` files in the repository and run the resulting executable:
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
$ ./hsh
